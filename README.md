## Current ideas taken from thread

1. A Final Fantasy or Pokemon style JRPG with romanceable party members.
Processors, OSes, other hardware and software suites, become the Waifus
   - Make the moves programming and hardware memes.
     - i.e. ((recurse)), repeat the last move, may cause overflow.

2. An rts based on the spaceships from conways game of life. 
   - Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FaqC4h5Ftg

3. An F-zero clone.

4. A rougelike game with randomly generated waifu routes.

5. Feelgood Yotsuba-like adventure game

6. A roguelike with magic based combat, randomly generated spells.

7. Metroidvania with /g/ references.

8. Cyberpunk Action RPG revolving around gameplay loop of conquering, exploring, and upgrading territory run by android/cyborg gangs.
   - Some gang bosses are women

### Notes:
There MUST be Waifus
